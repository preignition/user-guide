# Introduction

### Purpose

This user guide is intended to provide entrepreneurs and users with clear instructions so they can use Preignition effectively.

### Audience

There are 3 separate audiences for this user guide.

| **Entrepreneurs**                                                                                       | Entrepreneurs use Preignition to apply to and communicate with accelerator programs and impact investors.  They only use a few areas of the platform such as the homepage and entrepreneur space.  The user experience is highly intuitive and there should be no need to refer to a User Guide.   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Program Users** | Program Users work for accelerator programs or impact investment funds.  They use Preignition to manage their relationship with businesses.  Some of the features available to Program Users are under development and many are not as intuitive as we intend them to be.  Therefore Program Users are encouraged to make use of this User Guide. |
| **Advanced Users** | Advanced Users work for accelerator program or impact investment funds.  They are responsible for tailoring Preignition for the specific needs of their program or fund.  They will undertake more advanced tasks than Program Users.  For instance an Advanced User will create a selection workflow and design selection surveys.  The features available to Advanced Users are under development and are not as intuitive as we intend them to be.  Therefore Advanced Users are encouraged to make use of this User Guide. |

### Structure

This User Guide has been structured around the audiences described above.  The first section is intended for entrepreneurs, the second section for Users \(Program and Advanced\).  

There are two Frequently Asked Question sections, one for entrepreneurs and one for Users .

Please contact info@preignition.org if these instructions are not clear or if you still have questions.
