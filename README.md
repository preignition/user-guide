# Introduction

### Purpose

This user guide is intended to provide a user with clear instructions so they can use Preignition effectively.

Please contact info@preignition.org if these instructions are not clear or if you still have questions.

### Audience

There are 3 separate audiences for this user guide.

| **Entrepreneurs**                                                                                       | Entrepreneurs use Preignition to apply to and communicate with accelerator programs and impact investors.  They only use a few areas of the platform such as the homepage and entrepreneur space.  The user experience is highly intuitive and there should be no need to refer to a User Guide.   |

| **Program Users** | Program Users work for accelerator programs or impact investment funds.  They use Preignition to manage their relationship with businesses.  The features available to Program Users are under development and are not as intuitive as we intend them to be.  Therefore Program Users are encouraged to make use of this User Guide. |
| **Advanced Users** | Advanced Users work for accelerator program or impact investment funds.  They are responsible for tailoring Preignition for their specific program or fund and will undertake more advanced tasks than Program Users.  For instance an Advanced User will create a selection workflow and design selection surveys.  The features available to Advanced Users are under development and are not as intuitive as we intend them to be.  Therefore Advanced Users are encouraged to make use of this User Guide. |
