# Entrepreneur space

### Step 1-  Overview of the 'entrepreneur space'

* Once an entrepreneur has created an account on preignition and applied to a program, they will automatically be directed to their 'entrepreneur space'
* The entrepreneur space is customized to reflect the branding of the program that the entrepreneur has applied for.

### Step 2-  Bulletin board

* This is where entrepreneurs will receive messages and calls to action from the program they have applied to.
* For instance an entrepreneur maybe invited to [complete a survey](https://docs.preignition.org/~/edit/drafts/-LGf63xP-P20DbsmGzBQ/entrepreneurs/completing-a-survey).  

### Step 3- User Profile

* The entrepreneur can also edit their [User Profile](https://docs.preignition.org/~/edit/drafts/-LGf63xP-P20DbsmGzBQ/entrepreneurs/user-profile) from their entrepreneur space.
