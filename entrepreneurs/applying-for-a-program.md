# Applying for a program

### Step 1- Program specific landing page

* Each program which uses preignition has its own landing page.
* This can be accessed via a link on the program's own website or via the preignition homepage

### Step 3-  Entrepreneur space

* Once an entrepreneur has created an account and applied to a program, they should automatically be directed to an 'entrepreneur space' where they will receive messages from the program they have applied to.
