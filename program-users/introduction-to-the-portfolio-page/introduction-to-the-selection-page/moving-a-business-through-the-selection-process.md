# Moving a business through the selection process

### Step 1- On a 'review' node, click on the box beside a business name.

![A single or multiple businesses can be selected](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only users with appropriate authorization rights can change the status of a business
{% endhint %}

* The banner at the top of the page changes and shows the number of businesses that have been selected.  An options menu appears on the right-hand side

![In this example, 2 business have been selected](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

### Step 2- Change the status of the selected business

{% hint style="info" %}
The options are always to reject the business or move it to the next stage in the selection process
{% endhint %}

### Step 3- Confirm your choice

* As a safeguard a user will always be asked to confirm the changes they are about to make

### Step 4- Refresh the page
