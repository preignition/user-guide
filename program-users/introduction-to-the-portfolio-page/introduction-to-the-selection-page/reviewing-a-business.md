# Reviewing a business

### Step 1- Select the ‘review’ node in a selection process

* Select the available surveys and check that all surveys have been completed

### Step 2- Use the selection dashboard to filter the business list

* If required, a user can use the selection dashboard to filter the businesses to be reviewed.

![In this example only agribusinesses which are limited by shares have been selected](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

### Step 3- Access detailed information submitted by a business

In the future a reviewer will be able to ‘score’ narrative answers directly from this page
{% endhint %}

### Step 4- Assign a business to a pre-review 'category'

* If the reviewer has reviewed a business but doesn’t want to change its status yet, they can assign it to a pre-review category

![In this example the business has been categorized as &apos;pre-selected&apos;](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

* The list can then be filtered to show businesses based on their pre-review status.

![The example shows 4 businesses that have been &#x2018;pre-selected&#x2019;](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png)
