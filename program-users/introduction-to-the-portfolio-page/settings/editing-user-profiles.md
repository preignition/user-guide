# My profile

### Step 1

Entrepreneurs can access the 'My Profile' page from their [Entrepreneurs Space](https://docs.preignition.org/~/edit/primary/entrepreneurs/entrepreneur-space).  Program Users and Advanced Users can also assess their 'My Profile' page from [Settings](https://docs.preignition.org/~/edit/primary/program-users/introduction-to-the-portfolio-page/settings).
