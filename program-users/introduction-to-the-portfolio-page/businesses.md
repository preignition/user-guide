# Businesses

The Businesses page is where a user can report on the performance of their program.

A wide variety of reports can be run using data which has been collected from businesses and is available on the platform.  

Examples of reports include:

* Portfolio reports showing the key characteristics of a group of businesses at a point in time

* Impact reports showing the progress a business or group of businesses has made over time
* Bench marking reports showing how a business or group of businesses compares to a wider group.

The Business page is under development and is currently not accessible from www.preignition.org.  We will be working closely with accelerator programs and impact investors to understand their reporting requirements
